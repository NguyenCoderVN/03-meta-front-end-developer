# HTML5 Description List (`<dl>`) Example and Explanation

This section explains the `<dl>` HTML element, which is used to create description lists.

## What is a Description List?

A **description list** (`<dl>`) is a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. It's particularly useful for glossaries, metadata lists, or any scenario where you have name-value pairs.

---

## Key Elements

* **`<dl>` (Description List):** This is the **parent container** for the entire description list.
* **`<dt>` (Description Term):** This element defines a **term or name** in the description list.
* **`<dd>` (Description Details):** This element defines the **description or definition** for the preceding `<dt>`.

## Example Breakdown

In the provided HTML example (not included here, but typically found in the project's `index.html` or similar file), "HTML", "CSS", and "JavaScript" are the **terms** (`<dt>`), and the paragraphs following each term are their respective **descriptions** (`<dd>`). The CSS included in that example provides basic styling to make the description list more readable and visually appealing.
